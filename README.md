# Swamp Blimps

## Overview
Our team works as part of a research organization in a laboratory that creates autonomous 
lighter-than-air (LTA) blimps. The goal of this project is to update the existing basestation by making it web-based for multiple users to access it at once. This will allow the pilot to use the basestation to select and control the blimps while other users can view blimp livestreams, machine learning data, etc.

## Summary
This repository contains the basestation code. The basestation is primarily used to view all available blimps and send commands to the currently connected blimp through the use of an Xbox controller or keyboard. A secondary feature of the basestation is the ability to view livestreams from each blimp, which is available through a hyperlink using the stream section of the main page on the basestation.
